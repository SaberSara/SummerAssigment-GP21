# Summary:

During the assignment, I have chosen the simplest of the proposed projects, the Paragliding, due to my new and fresh knowledge of unreal and my delay on giving the assignment and doing it in the correct time.


In this project called “GliderMan”, the purpose is very simple: enjoy a glide view and discovery of the mountain with controls, the water is solid and the water is not making you drawn. The player can enjoy going to high rock picks that are only accessible by the glider.
The player is helding “Q”to open his glider and fly.
Extra goal: There is no wind constraint and the space is free to explore, there was an attempt to make collectable items but for delivery sake it has been paused. Only a menu is created with Start,Qui and setting but as a disabled button (non-functional).The main learning point gotten are: 
- Created my real first project in Unreal Engine, 
- Imported the player and practiced retargeting, 
- practiced in Level blueprint,Animation Blueprint, Player controller, 
- Learned importing and changing characters from the mannequins while keeping the original blueprints
- learned about importing sound, practiced UI and interactibility, 
- practiced level switching, 
- practised importing FBX files from non-marketplace and assemble them in the Unreal Editor,
- learned to import Mixamo animation and retarget them.

Challenges:
- Retargeting and ik, skeleton mesh broken and half animated
- Build (packaging) for windows handling
